

basic features:

2d engine that can draw sprites, maybe tinting.


the engine manages entities basicly rectangluar shapes that have a position inculding height, rotation, a sprite, flags and tinting associated with them and also spritesets
which are basicly textures that entities link to for their texture.

for each frame all active sprites are drawn.
the user can create new spritesets from textures (divding a texture into smaller parts or using it as a whole)
the user can also create entities and manage their attributes (position, rotation etc.)


propably flipping sprites
unsure font-spritemaps

propably not: render to texture and then render that texture to the screen (->retro look)

missing on purpose:
	no real 3d, no real lighting(only through tinting), no need to load 3d models, animation only though sprite changing
